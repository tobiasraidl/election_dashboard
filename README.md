### TODO

[ ] search function for hash to get image details

[ ] mono multi platform filter if nothing checkd just display all platforms example: 3 radio boxes and always load images that were shared on exactly these 2 platforms (not more not less)

[x] accounts instead of people

[ ] click on cluster -> show network of the cluster with edges thickness (and weight for cose) mapped to how many same images these people shared [ ] cluster graph add weights and edge thickness based on how many connections between clusters

technical todos: [x] prefilter the all_posts.csv dataframe (e.g. only include rows that are used -> 2dfs: for platform only ones that have at least same hash; for accs only that have party and same) [ ] check why sometimes on bar click of bar chart nothing happens [ ] check why sometimes the page doesnt scroll down when clicking on edge connection [ ] when bar in barchart is clicked already open the modal with a spinner until shit is loaded

Datasets Description
