# Network Dashboard

[x] Create clusters as lists of node ids of graph  
[x] Visualise clusters as nodes (size proportional to cluster size)  
[x] Edge between two clusters that are connected (edge width proportional to num of unique paths)  
[x] Slider that sets the minimum cluster size to be displayed  
[ ] Slider that sets the max length of the shortest path between two clusters to make an edge between them (no more any path counts)  

Click on edge ->  

[x] New view. Both adjacent clusters to the clicked edge and the shortest paths between them
[ ] Implement details when click on cluster in connection view



[ ] Labels for sliders

suppress_callback_exceptions=True if i want to callback on an element that will be generated by other callback


### Cross Platform Graph Vis Ideas
##### 1.
- node: aggregation of posts on the same platform and with same hash; size of node is how many posts aggregated; color is mapped toplatform
- edge: nodes with same hash
- This results in groups of 3 nodes that are connected, one node per platform

##### 2.
- graph only contains posts in a specific timespan (selected by range slider)
- node: post; color: platform;
- edge: same hash
