### TODO

[ ] search function for hash to get image details

[ ] visualise loading when modals are opening but still loading

[ ] mono multi platform filter if nothing checkd just display all platforms example: 3 radio boxes and always load images that were shared on exactly these 2 platforms (not more not less)

[x] accounts instead of people

[ ] click on cluster -> show network of the cluster with edges thickness (and weight for cose) mapped to how many same images these people shared [ ] cluster graph add weights and edge thickness based on how many connections between clusters
    1. make callback similar to connection graph modal toggle callback
    2. left graph, right node info on click
    3. graph contains accounts of the cluster clicked as nodes with edges if they have shared the same image. 

technical todos: [x] prefilter the all_posts.csv dataframe (e.g. only include rows that are used -> 2dfs: for platform only ones that have at least same hash; for accs only that have party and same) [ ] check why sometimes on bar click of bar chart nothing happens [ ] check why sometimes the page doesnt scroll down when clicking on edge connection [ ] when bar in barchart is clicked already open the modal with a spinner until shit is loaded

Datasets Description
All datasets in data/ are transformations of data/original_posts.csv which are generated by the.

load the dataframes needed on each page and dont store them
