### Datasets Description
All datasets in data/ are transformations of data/original_posts.csv which are generated by the.

### TODO


[x] mono multi platform filter if nothing checked just display all platforms example: 3 radio boxes and always load images that were shared on exactly these 2 platforms (not more not less)

[x] accounts instead of people

[x] click on cluster -> show network of the cluster with edges thickness (and weight for cose) mapped to how many same images these people shared [ ] cluster graph add weights and edge thickness based on how many connections between clusters
    1. make callback similar to connection graph modal toggle callback
    2. left graph, right node info on click
    3. graph contains accounts of the cluster clicked as nodes with edges if they have shared the same image. 
    4. slider to select min same images shared to visualise edge

[ ] add image into each bar of the barchart
    1. get all the possible images that appear at a bar chart into the assets directory (sub dirs)
    2. downscale all the relevant images
    3. implement as i did in the prototype

##### Technical TODOS: 
[x] prefilter the all_posts.csv dataframe (e.g. only include rows that are used -> 2dfs: for platform only ones that have at least same hash; for accs only that have party and same)
[x] check why sometimes on bar click of bar chart nothing happens
[x] check why sometimes the page doesnt scroll down when clicking on edge connection

[x] load the dataframes needed on each page and dont store them

[ ] visualise loading when modals are opening but still loading

[ ] on cluster inspection graph show images when clicked on an edge


##### maybe do

[ ] search function for hash to get image details

### BUGS
on bar click of image that is half red half dark blue error
reason: twitter not found (because never posted on twitter)

[x] ffc6124c03339cf4 has no image -> has no image

[ ] on image details timeline plot colors are incorrect

[ ] on cluster click sometimes the nodes in cluster inspection are not correct color
