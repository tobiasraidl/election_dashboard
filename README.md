# Network Dashboard

[x] Create clusters as lists of node ids of graph  
[x] Visualise clusters as nodes (size proportional to cluster size)  
[x] Edge between two clusters that are connected (edge width proportional to num of unique paths)  
[x] Slider that sets the minimum cluster size to be displayed  
[ ] Slider that sets the max length of the shortest path between two clusters to make an edge between them (no more any path counts)  

Click on edge ->  

[x] New view. Both adjacent clusters to the clicked edge and the shortest paths between them
[ ] Implement details when click on cluster in connection view
